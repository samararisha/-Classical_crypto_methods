<h1>Classical Cipher Implementations in Python</h1>

<p>This repository contains Python implementations of classical ciphers used for encryption and decryption. These algorithms are some of the foundational methods in cryptography, historically significant for their simplicity and pedagogical value. The project includes the following well-known ciphers:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Caesar Cipher</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Vigen√®re Cipher</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Monoalphabetic Cipher</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Hill Cipher</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Play Fair cipher</strong></li>

    
</ul>

<p>These implementations are ideal for learning and experimenting with basic cryptographic concepts and understanding how classical encryption techniques work.</p>
